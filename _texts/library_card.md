## Library Card

This is a section of the sketchbook where I write about the books that I am reading. 
The pieces here will be a collection of blind contour recaps, notes, references, and 
whatever else comes up. Much of this will be inspired by two of my current favorite
podcasts, [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and 
[Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). If you have
not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I suggest you stop what you are
doing right now, and check them out.
